# nofollow
An SEO oriented plugin aimed to discourage 'dofollow' back-link building SPAM in e107 powered websites. Inserts nofollow optionally on per-link basis. Links with an rel='nofollow' attribute generate no positive benefits in search engine algorithmic perspective for the poster and they are mostly dropped out of search engine link graph.
