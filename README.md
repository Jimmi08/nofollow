# nofollow
An SEO oriented e107 plugin aimed to put off back-link building SPAM posts in e107 powered websites. Simply put it inserts rel='nofollow' attribute to user posted links. But its behavior is dependent on lots of variables which the plugin monitors and can be controlled by means of various plugin options.

Links with an rel='nofollow' attribute generate no positive benefits in search engine algorithmic perspective for the poster and they are mostly dropped out of search engine link graph.
