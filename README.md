# nofollow
An SEO oriented plugin aimed to discourage back-link building SPAM link posts in e107 powered websites. It inserts nofollow attribute to posted links with lots of options. 
 
Links with an rel='nofollow' attribute generate no positive benefits in search engine algorithmic perspective for the poster and they are mostly dropped out of search engine link graph.
